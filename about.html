    <h1>Welcome to Retro Code: Crafting the Essence of Classic Gaming</h1>
    At Retro Code, I am passionate about bringing the charm of retro gaming back to life with a modern twist. My latest project is the development of a captivating web page that showcases my studio and my unique approach to game development. Here's a behind-the-scenes look at the methods and tools I used to bring this project to fruition.

    <h2>Text and Layout</h2>
    I ensured that all textual content on our website is properly formatted just using HTML and CSS. This approach allows for consistent styling and a professional look.

    <h2>Image Editing</h2>
    I used GIMP to edit and process photographs, ensuring high-quality visuals that capture the essence of our games. We then integrated these images on our site using custom HTML and CSS, providing visitors with an immersive visual experience.

    <h2>Vector Graphics and Animations</h2>
    To create and refine vector graphics, I leveraged tools like Inkscape. These graphics add a polished and cohesive look to my website. For animations, we utilized Blender, bringing static images to life.

    <h2>Audio Production</h2>
    Sound plays a crucial role in the gaming experience. I processed audio content using Audacity. These audio elements are seamlessly integrated into our web page, enhancing the overall user experience.

    <h2>Video Integration</h2>
    Our video presentations, created with DaVinci Resolve, provide an engaging overview of our products and services. These videos are embedded into our website, offering visitors a comprehensive look at what Retro Code has to offer.

    <h2>Step-by-Step Documentation</h2>
    For each of the multimedia elements, I documented the creation process in detail. This includes the tools used, the steps taken, and the techniques applied, ensuring transparency and a clear understanding of my methods.

    <h2>Applying Knowledge from Basics of ICT</h2>
    In addition to the specialized tools, we applied knowledge gained from the ICT basics course to produce the core structure of our website using only HTML and CSS. This foundational approach ensured that our web page is both functional and visually appealing, adhering to web standards and best practices.

    Join us at Retro Code as we continue to celebrate the golden age of gaming with our meticulously crafted web page. Dive into our world and experience the nostalgia and excitement of retro gaming like never before.
