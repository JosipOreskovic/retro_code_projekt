        <h2>Step-by-Step Tutorial: Creating the Spliting Trailer in DaVinci Resolve</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Import assets</strong><br>
                Four PNG images, one gameplay video, two music tracks, and titles were imported into DaVinci Resolve.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Arrange timeline</strong><br>
                Images and video were placed in order to build the trailer’s flow.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add titles</strong><br>
                Text overlays were added to every image and over the video, each animated with fade-in and fade-out for smooth readability.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Apply transitions</strong><br>
                Swipe left transitions were used between images for seamless visual movement.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Work on audio</strong><br>
                Two music tracks were layered and volume adjusted, with fade-in and fade-out effects for natural audio transitions.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Final touches</strong><br>
                Titles were synced with visuals, timing checked, transitions refined, and the finished trailer exported.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="result">✅ Final Result: A polished trailer with smooth transitions, synced audio, and clear titles.</p>
